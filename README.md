# Static Comp 2 Was...
a composition of a website given to challenge the dev with multiple aspects of what we have learned so far this mod, including but not limited to: grid, flex, positioning, tables, responsive layouts, media queries, animations, images, alignment, design, and typography.

The comp given:

# Things I Learned

I learned how to code and create SVGs from scratch, how to style them, and how to size them. I learned how to use grid and flexbox together to create an effective full webpage layout. I also learned how to style lists in a variety of ways, how to implement a boatload of icons, and I think I vastly enhanced my hovering techniques.

# Remaining Areas for Improvement

I would like to perfect the spacing in my graph section- the size of the graphs are exactly even-I was unsure how to combat this as I just learned to code the graphs. This is something I would like to leanr more about and come back to perfect. I would also like to improve the table further- I was unable to get the lines on the table to have a padding while the table header did not, and unable to get the photo and the text next to it perfectly aligned.

# Wishlist

I tried for a while to create pop-up labels on hover for the graphs, and I think I got pretty close! But, ultimately I had to call it and move on to other aspects of the page. I would really like to learn how to implement those for a fully interactivce svg graph. I also wanted to create functionality for the vertical nav bar so that it appears off screen upon click. I left this for last because there were so many other aspects of the page to accomplish, though I am happy with where I ended. I also would have liked to make the edit table functioning, although it would take use of local storage if I wanted the information to save-which isn't something I would implement on a static composition page.
