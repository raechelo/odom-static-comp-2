# Static Comp 2 Was...
a composition of a website given to challenge the dev with multiple aspects of what we have learned so far this mod, including but not limited to: grid, flex, positioning, tables, responsive layouts, media queries, animations, images, alignment, design, and typography.

The comp given:

# Things I Learned

I learned how to code and create SVGs from scratch, how to style them, and how to size them. I learned how to use grid and flexbox together to create an effective full webpage layout. I started to dabble a little bit into animations and I had some fun with those, I wish I had time to put animations on the bar graph too. I also learned how to style lists in a variety of ways, how to implement a boatload of icons, and I think I vastly enhanced my hovering techniques.

# Remaining Areas for Improvement

I would like to perfect the spacing in my graph section- the size of the graphs are exactly even-I was unsure how to combat this as I just learned to code the graphs. This is something I would like to leanr more about and come back to perfect. I would also like to improve the table further- I was unable to get the lines on the table to have a padding while the table header did not, and unable to get the photo and the text next to it perfectly aligned.

# Wishlist

I tried for a while to create pop-up labels on hover for the graphs, and I think I got pretty close! But, ultimately I had to call it and move on to other aspects of the page. I would really like to learn how to implement those for a fully interactivce svg graph. I also wanted to create functionality for the vertical nav bar so that it appears off screen upon click. I left this for last because there were so many other aspects of the page to accomplish, though I am happy with where I ended. I also would have liked to make the edit table functioning, although it would take use of local storage if I wanted the information to save-which isn't something I would implement on a static composition page. I've already mentioned it, but I would have liked to animate the bars in the bar graph to move upward upon hover effects.

# Final Thoughts

I'm very happy with where I ended for this project. It was very intense and took a lot of work; just when I thought I was done, I still put in a whole day's worth of work. I went a little crazy with hover effects and put them on all the icons in the search bar at the top, the buttons to the left below that, the list items in the sidebar, the SVGs and their information, and the table edit button. I am really happy with my graphs that I created, it was a long night and a lot of codepens before I understood what to do and how to do it, but it was so worth it.
