#Static Comp 2 Was...
-a composition of a website given to challenge the dev with multiple aspects of what we have learned so far this mod, including but not limited to: grid, flex, positioning, tables, responsive layouts, media queries, animations, images, alignment, design, and typography.

The comp given:

#Things I Learned:

I learned how to code and create SVGs from scratch, how to style them, and how to size them. I learned how to use grid and flexbox together to create an effective full webpage layout. I also learned how to style lists in a variety of ways, how to implement a boatload of icons, and I think I vastly enhanced my hovering techniques.

#Remaining Areas for Improvement

I would like to perfect the spacing in my graph section as well as the spacing in my vertical navigation bar. I had a lot of issues with styling that how I wanted it-I was able to space it evenly with grid but unable to use hover effects like I wanted while using grid. This caused me to use a margin around the icons and because they aren't all the same size, the spacing is very slightly off. I was unable to overcome this and would like to find out how to fix it so the spacing is perfectly even.

#Wishlist

I would like to create functionality for the vertical nav bar, so that it appears off screen. I left this for last because there were so many other aspects of the page to accomplish. I am happy with where I ended. I also would have liked to make the edit table functioning, although it would take use of local storage if I wanted the information to save-which isn't something I would implement on a static composition page.
